# Semantic3DNet - PyTorch

This is the source code of our project for Machine Learning for 3D Geometry course in 2022 summer semester.

In this project, we aim to reimplement [Semantic3DNet](https://github.com/nsavinov/semantic3dnet) Benchmark Model in PyTorch since Torch7 is not supported anymore.

## Running the Code

The code runs on Colab directly. You can run it by clicking on the "Run" button in the top right corner. For local runs, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib, and PyTorch. Also this project depends on the original [Semantic3DNet](https://github.com/nsavinov/semantic3dnet) code.
